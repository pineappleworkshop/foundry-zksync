### Summary Report on Current Challenges with Remappings Algorithm and Proposed Workarounds

---

Present state of our remapping algorithm implementation for the Foundry/zksync project. Despite rigorous efforts, our current system has encountered hurdles in effectively remapping and retrieving files from the mono repo. Initial strategies to integrate a “context” have not yielded the desired outcomes. A brief overview of the primary challenges and actions taken are detailed below.

#### 1. Challenges with Remappings Algorithm

- **Issue:**

  - The remappings algorithm currently does not fully facilitate the proper retrieval of remapped files from the mono repo.
  - Inability to securely and reliably connect remapped paths to their respective destinations.

- **Attempts at Resolution:**
  - Incorporated a "context" as a potential solution, but unfortunately, this has not rectified the problem. This can still be worked on.
  - Opted for a streamlined “happy path” for MUD, which includes compiling sources locally as a provisional solution.

#### 2. Adopted Workarounds and Immediate Fixes

- **Local Compilation:**

  - All sources are being pulled down and compiled locally as a direct and immediate workaround.
  - This method, although effective in the short term, is not a viable long-term solution given its manual and resource-intensive nature.

- **Challenges with Local Compilation:**
  - Pulling source code from the mono repo and writing it to a temporary directory necessitates a comprehensive rewrite of all import paths in contracts to align with the new folder.
  - This approach lacks scalability and introduces additional complexities such as managing import paths and ensuring code consistency.

#### 3. Current State and Pending Actions

- **Accomplishments:**
  - Successfully accessing all sources and facilitated writing to a local file.
- **Requirements to complete:**
  - Need to complete mechanism to organize, deduplicate, and account for instances of identical filenames to ensure systematic and error-free compilation and execution.
- **Upcoming Focal Points:**
  - Continue to explore automation opportunities to streamline local compilation and minimize the risk of errors.
  - Continue investigations into a viable method to make the remappings algorithm effectively recognize and retrieve files from the mono repo.

#### 4. Moving Forward: Proposed Strategic Approaches

- **Enhancing the Remappings Algorithm:**

  - Explore potential enhancements or alternative algorithms that ensure precise and reliable remapping of files. Mainly the 'context' approach.

- **Complete Local Comilation Approach:**
  - Continue to refine the local compilation approach to acheive a happy path in a timely fashion.

#### Conclusion

Your understanding and patience as we navigate through these challenges are immensely appreciated. Our team is ardently working towards formulating a resilient, scalable, and reliable solution that ensures seamless file remapping and/or local compilation. We remain committed to delivering a solution that adheres to the high standards expected of us and ensures the operational efficacy of Foundry/zksync.

We will continue to keep you informed of our progress and are available for any further discussions or clarifications you may seek.
